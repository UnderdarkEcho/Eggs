Project Title: Egg Pricing Calculator App

Document Version: 1.0

Date: October 2023
1. Overview
1.1 Purpose

The Egg Pricing Calculator app helps backyard chicken keepers and small-scale farmers determine how much to charge for the eggs their hens produce. By accounting for both fixed and variable costs, egg production rates, and a desired profit margin, the app provides users with a suggested selling price per dozen eggs and insights into their profitability.
1.2 Target Audience

    Backyard chicken keepers
    Small-scale egg producers
    Hobby farmers looking to sell eggs locally

2. Features
2.1 Cost Calculation

    Fixed Costs Input:
        Total fixed costs (e.g., coop, equipment).
        Expected lifespan of fixed assets in years.
    Variable Costs Input:
        Monthly variable costs (e.g., feed, bedding).
    Calculation:
        Monthly fixed cost based on depreciation.
        Total monthly cost (fixed + variable).

2.2 Egg Production Tracking

    Input:
        Number of hens.
        Average eggs per hen per month.
    Calculation:
        Total eggs produced monthly.
        Total dozens produced monthly.

2.3 Profit Margin Calculator

    Input:
        Desired profit margin percentage (0% to 99%).
    Calculation:
        Cost per dozen eggs.
        Suggested selling price per dozen.
        Profit per dozen.

2.4 User-Friendly Interface

    Simple form for data input.
    Clear display of calculation results.
    Basic input validation to ensure correct data entry.

2.5 Educational Content (Optional)

    Tips on reducing costs or increasing egg production (e.g., links to resources or brief suggestions).

3. User Interface
3.1 Layout

    Single-Page Web App:
        A form section for user inputs.
        A results section to display calculations (hidden until calculations are performed).

3.2 Form Inputs

    Fixed Costs:
        "Total fixed costs (e.g., coop, equipment):" (number input, min=0)
        "Expected lifespan of fixed assets (years):" (number input, min=1)
    Variable Costs:
        "Monthly variable costs (e.g., feed):" (number input, min=0)
    Egg Production:
        "Number of hens:" (number input, min=1)
        "Average eggs per hen per month:" (number input, min=0.1)
    Profit Margin:
        "Desired profit margin (%):" (number input, min=0, max=99)

3.3 Results Display

    "Cost per dozen: $X.XX"
    "Suggested selling price per dozen: $X.XX"
    "Profit per dozen: $X.XX"

3.4 Styling

    Clean, minimal design.
    Responsive layout to support mobile and desktop browsers.

4. Functionality
4.1 Calculations

The app performs the following calculations:

    Monthly Fixed Cost:
    Monthly Fixed Cost=(Total Fixed CostLifespan in Years)/12
    Monthly Fixed Cost=(Lifespan in YearsTotal Fixed Cost​)/12
    Total Monthly Cost:
    Total Monthly Cost=Monthly Fixed Cost+Monthly Variable Cost
    Total Monthly Cost=Monthly Fixed Cost+Monthly Variable Cost
    Total Eggs and Dozens:
    Total Eggs=Number of Hens×Average Eggs per Hen per Month
    Total Eggs=Number of Hens×Average Eggs per Hen per Month
    Total Dozens=Total Eggs12
    Total Dozens=12Total Eggs​
    Cost per Dozen:
    Cost per Dozen=Total Monthly CostTotal Dozens
    Cost per Dozen=Total DozensTotal Monthly Cost​
    Suggested Selling Price:
    Selling Price=Cost per Dozen1−(Profit Margin %100)
    Selling Price=1−(100Profit Margin %​)Cost per Dozen​
    Profit per Dozen:
    Profit per Dozen=Selling Price−Cost per Dozen
    Profit per Dozen=Selling Price−Cost per Dozen

4.2 Input Validation

    All inputs must be positive numbers.
    Specific constraints:
        Fixed costs, variable costs: ≥ 0
        Lifespan: ≥ 1 year
        Number of hens: ≥ 1
        Eggs per hen: > 0
        Profit margin: 0% to 99%
    Display an error message if invalid inputs are detected (e.g., "Please enter valid numbers: costs must be non-negative, lifespan and eggs per hen must be positive, hens at least 1, profit margin between 0 and 99%.").

4.3 User Flow

    User fills out the form with their cost, production, and profit margin data.
    User clicks "Calculate."
    App validates inputs.
    If valid, app performs calculations and displays results.
    If invalid, app shows an error message.

5. Sample Scenarios
5.1 Example Input and Output

Input:

    Total fixed costs: $1000
    Expected lifespan: 5 years
    Monthly variable costs: $50
    Number of hens: 10
    Average eggs per hen per month: 20
    Desired profit margin: 20%

Calculations:

    Monthly Fixed Cost: ($1000 / 5) / 12 ≈ $16.67
    Total Monthly Cost: $16.67 + $50 = $66.67
    Total Eggs: 10 * 20 = 200
    Total Dozens: 200 / 12 ≈ 16.67
    Cost per Dozen: $66.67 / 16.67 ≈ $4.00
    Selling Price: $4.00 / (1 - 0.20) = $5.00
    Profit per Dozen: $5.00 - $4.00 = $1.00

Output:

    Cost per dozen: $4.00
    Suggested selling price per dozen: $5.00
    Profit per dozen: $1.00

5.2 Edge Case

Input:

    Total fixed costs: $0
    Expected lifespan: 1 year
    Monthly variable costs: $0
    Number of hens: 1
    Average eggs per hen per month: 0.1
    Desired profit margin: 0%

Output:

    Cost per dozen: $0.00
    Suggested selling price per dozen: $0.00
    Profit per dozen: $0.00

6. Technology Stack

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
    No Backend Required: All logic runs client-side in the browser.
    Deployment: Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).

7. Additional Notes

    The app should round all monetary values to two decimal places.
    Optionally, include a brief explanation or tooltips for each input field to guide users (e.g., "Fixed costs include one-time purchases like coops and equipment.").
    Consider adding a "Reset" button to clear the form and hide results.
